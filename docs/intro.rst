Introduction
============

We build secure people
----------------------

Information security is often misunderstood. Most people believe that
if you throw enough gadgets at an organisation you will mitigate any
potential vulnerability. Technology is only a fraction of the picture.
Information security is at its heart a human problem. Wherever there
exists choice, there is risk.

    We specialise in the **Assessment**, **Visualization** and **Analysis** of human organisational information security risk.

AVA maps the realities of your organisation, its structures, and
behaviours. This map of people and interconnected entities can then be
tested using a unique suite of customisable on-demand and scheduled
information security awareness tests.

The results of this combine into a detailed risk profile of your
organisation unlike any other tool can provide - from the people up. A
diverse set of analysis and visualization tools can then be employed
to predict departments, locations, and people who pose the most risk
allowing limited educational and defensive budgets to be used where
they are most needed.

AVA Secure puts the people first in security assessment, leaving your
organisation visibly more secure.

License and Open sourcing
-------------------------

We believe that security tools based on secret recipes are
dangerous. Security solutions should always be subject to
scrutiny. Open sourcing AVA allows us to be seen and for collaborators
to get involved. Only together can we make AVA the best first step to
protecting your people.

AVA is released under GPL v3. If you aren't sure what this means then
you should probably `read
this <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_.  If the terms of GPL
are not suitable to your environment, please get in touch. We would be
happy to discuss this with you.

Eventually there may be paid services or components based around
AVA. The core will always remain free and open source for those who
want to run it internally.
